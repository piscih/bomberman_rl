"""
train.py -- only imported when the framework is asked for a training agent.

This agent is a FROZEN EXPORT. Its model is a table of numpy arrays extracted
from mayank_gbt's fitted scikit-learn ensemble by analysis/export_gbt_numpy.py,
and there is no gradient, no replay buffer and no estimator to refit here: the
whole point of the export is that scikit-learn is not installed at all, so the
boosted trees cannot be grown further in this process.

Training therefore happens in mayank_gbt, and the result is re-exported:

    BOMBERMAN_RUN=gbt_v2_target_r40000 python main.py play --agents mayank_gbt --train 1 ...
    python3 analysis/export_gbt_numpy.py \
        --model agent_code/mayank_gbt/runs/gbt_v2_target_r40000/model.joblib \
        --out   agent_code/mayank_agent/model.npz \
        --action-mask safe

The three callbacks below exist because the framework's AGENT_API requires them
to be present whenever an agent is constructed with train=True (agents.py checks
for them by name and by argument count, and raises NotImplementedError if either
is missing). They deliberately do nothing rather than raise: a tournament game
runs every agent with train=False, so this file is never even imported there,
and turning an accidental `--train 1` into a hard crash would be a worse failure
than playing correctly without learning. The warning is written to the agent log
AND to the console so that it cannot be mistaken for silent training.
