"""
callbacks.py -- always loaded by the framework.

The scikit-learn-free twin of mayank_gbt. Same model, same features, same
decisions -- but the boosted trees are stored as plain numpy arrays and walked
by the traversal in q_values() below, so nothing here imports scikit-learn.

Why. mayank_gbt loads its six fitted estimators from a joblib pickle, and a
pickle is only readable by a library version compatible with the one that wrote
it. That file records _sklearn_version 1.8.0, and scikit-learn >= 1.9.0 refuses
it outright with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_loss'`. The failure
lands inside setup(), so the agent dies before its first step rather than
playing badly. An unpinned `scikit-learn` in requirements.txt resolves to the
newest release, which means that crash is the DEFAULT outcome in a freshly
built environment. Exporting the trees to numpy removes the dependency and the
pickle together: this agent needs numpy and nothing else, and its model file is
read with allow_pickle=False, so it cannot execute code on load either.

What the model file holds. analysis/export_gbt_numpy.py flattens all 600 trees
(100 boosting iterations x 6 actions) into one node table, rewriting each tree's
child indices from tree-local to global so every action can be walked in a
single vectorised pass:

    node_feature       int32    which feature this node tests
    node_threshold     float64  the numerical split point
    node_left/right    int32    global index of each child
    node_value         float64  the leaf value (0 in internal nodes)
    node_is_leaf       uint8    stop here and read node_value
    node_missing_left  uint8    where a NaN feature goes
    tree_root          int32    global index of each tree's root
    tree_action        int32    which action each tree contributes to
    baseline           float64  per-action baseline prediction

The arithmetic. scikit-learn's HistGradientBoosting applies the learning rate as
shrinkage when a leaf is finalised during FITTING, not at prediction time, so
the stored leaf values already carry the factor 0.1 and the prediction is an
unweighted sum:

    Q(s, a) = baseline[a] + sum over that action's 100 trees of leaf_value

`leaf_scale` is carried in the file (and is 1.0) so that the summation stays
explicit rather than relying on that fact being remembered. The loss is
HalfSquaredError, whose link is the identity, so predict() and the raw
prediction coincide and there is no inverse link to apply. The port is verified
against the scikit-learn model on real game states by
analysis/verify_gbt_numpy.py, which requires exact argmax agreement.

Everything below the "Features" heading is a byte-for-byte copy of
mayank_gbt/callbacks.py: the same 38 slots, the same urgency floor, the same
escape reasoning.
